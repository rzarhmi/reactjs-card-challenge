This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# ReactJS Card Challenge
A responsive card based design, to be implemented by React &amp; Redux

## Introduction 
In this challenge, you are going to develop a reactJS responsive web application which shows a 
random card on the page and has a 'Try' button. Whenever the user clicks on the 'Try' button, 
you should show him another card. (Order of the cards does not matter).

Each card has at least 2 items:
- title
- description

We have different Cards which are shown differently:

- **Picture Card** which shows a picture at the end of card content (code is 0)
- **Animated Card** which uses a special animation when it is shown (code is 1) (Use a good animation of your choice)
- **Sound Card** which plays a sound when the card is shown (code is 2)

Cards can be shown in different themes (meaning they are based on a different template), icon and color representing their tag:

- sport
- art
- fun

You can choose your desired template, icon and color for each theme.

Use the following URL to initialize the card list: [http://static.pushe.co/challenge/json](http://static.pushe.co/challenge/json).
Application state and data, fetched from the server, should be managed by **Redux**.
Write your unit tests using **Jest** for at least your reducer(s) and action generators. Use unit test best practices at your own discretion.

User is able to edit the title and description text on the cards and save it (just saved it locally, 
no need to send the saved data to the server). After hitting 'Try' button several times, when visiting the 
same card again: the saved text should be shown instead of the original server text (for both title and description).

## Expectations

We expect a clean, readable and maintainable code with meaningful comments.

## Task

1. Either clone or private fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend)
2. Develop the given challenge
3. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
3. Send us an email and notify us of completion! We'll take care about the rest and get back to you.

**Please do not start development before getting a confirmation from us**.

Happy Coding! ✊🏻
